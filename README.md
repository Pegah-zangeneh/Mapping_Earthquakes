# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

Before you add your folders and files to the Mapping_Earthquakes folder, Basil would like you to create a GitHub branch for the basic map. Basil informs you that creating a branch off the main branch allows you to create a new feature, or change some part of the original code. Once he has reviewed your code on your branch, Sadhana will show you how to merge it with the main branch.
